                        <p>
                            As a developer I always strive to write top quality code which is why I love using technologies such as <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://jsdoc.app/index.html">JSDoc</a> and <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>. I believe a good program sits on good code. My style of programming is always looking for the best solution in terms of reusability, flexibility and maintainability. Therefore I believe strongly in a functional approach to programming problems, with this method the application avoids repetetive code and enables reusability. With that said I don't have any problems using an object oriented style, I think     it's important to find the most optimal solution for the task.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm an active proponent of collaboration in my it's imperative to have good communication with team members in order to produce the best results. Asking and giving help or advice is something I strongly believe in.
